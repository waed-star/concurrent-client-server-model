The Scenario of this coursework is:

A farmer wishes to improve the management of his business through the use of
technology. He hires your team to devise a distributed system on a TCP/IP-based
network infrastructure composed of the following components, all connected to the
network:
  1. a number of digital weather stations controlled by microcomputers;
  
  2. a number of workstations manned by the farmer’s workers that will allow
  visualisation of information about the field, namely specific data related to
  each of the connected weather stations (e.g. temperature, barometric
  pressure, relative humidity, wind force, etc.) at the user’s request through a
  GUI;
  
  3. a central server machine that provides (also via a GUI):
  
  a. services for new weather stations to connect automatically on power-
    up and upload its data;
    
  b. services for new workstations to connect on log in (regulated by a user
    database), and, after successful connection, obtain an up-to-date
    description of the field and a list of connected weather stations, and
    download their respective data on request.
    
You will need to devise a Java-based concurrent client-server model to
implement this system
